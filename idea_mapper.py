Pitch-based scrolling - e.g. when you sing middle C, the document jumps to 50% mark. natural tool for voice recognition users/RSI/paralyzed patients

EEG-based Slumping Detector -- detect the pattern of brain activity that correlates with slumping / program that alerts me as is my posture begins to deteriorate so that I could correct it.. Could also just tells you to go to sleep. Helps people recover more quickly from RSI/carpal tunnel. Has interesting neuro/psych implications if it works as well. Would use Emotiv headset ~jcole@mit.edu

WorldThroughYourEyes -- What if you could make an app for Google Glasses or similar that follows a person's eyes and then and tracks where they are focusing. This way, you could  compare how different people focus differently, and analyze what that does to their lives. I also imagine that you could you could put on glasses yourself (or watch a screen), and then see the world through another person's eyes. ~jcole@mit.edu

InstaBoxSite: platform to build: generalized, easy to modify "suggestion box" framework anyone can use to quickly buildp a website off that mold.  All of following sites and countless more are based on fundamentally the same idea of a â€œcomments box: isawyou stackoverflow forums reddit fml formspring ideaoverflow.tk / hackathonprojects.tk suggestion box/politicalprogressbar ifiwereanmitstudent.tk tumblr twitter facebook wall
In parallel, I am able to protoype many of the websites I build these days with what is basically a google doc. Why not build a google doc with slightly more functionality that truly allows me to prototype these tools? Check out http://mitdocs.tk/ to see the potential of this. Relatedly, way for people to make a homepage as easily as they can make a google doc -- consider http://adamchu.tk/, and http://minimalisthomepages.tk/  ~jcole@mit.edu
