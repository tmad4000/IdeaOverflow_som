	'Index card sharing -- A good way to organize your thoughts is to write them down concisely. An index card seems like a good length for a unit of thought: longer than a quote or decontextualized summary, shorter than a story or lesson. Index cards seem a good way to transmit thoughts: it is easy to learn information presented in bite-sized chunks, each centered around some principle you can easily remember. The title of the card can act as a "slogan" for the principle.',\
	'I am inspired by Trefethens Index Cards: one mathematician wrote down his thoughts on science, education, politics, intelligence, etc. on ~350 index cards over a period of 40 years and published it as a book. (http://books.google.com/books/about/Trefethen_s_Index_Cards.html?id=hJT0tgAACAAJ)Minskys Society of Mind also strikes me as written in a similar way: while a page is more than an index card, the fact that each section is no more than a page has a focusing effect on the reader.',\
	'There are two parts to this project: allowing the user to create a system of cards, and then facilitating sharing.',\
	'Each index card has limited space but allows multimedia (for instance, putting in a simple picture/diagram as a symbol). You can hashtag index cards, search for others cards on similar topics, rate cards, provide links, and make "connections" between different cards (and possibly specify the kind of connection, for instance hierarchical), much like a semantic net. This gives a way to visualize someones thoughts (and almost "surf" their thoughts, in a way). I might have some good ideas which I write as a linear sequence of blog posts---but if I write them as index cards instead, this would force me to crystallize my ideas more, and allow them to be connected in a nonlinear fashion. Some possible uses: A card could be a quote, and then a anecdote around it. I could make one index card for every book I read, for instance---then anytime the book comes up in conversation I could pull up my index card on the phone and know exactly the thoughts I have about it, and be able to talk about it. (In fact, if I write up cards on a variety of topics, they could almost be a cheat sheet for conversation. If you had a repertoire of cards related to topics important to you, then you neednt grope for words, for instance, if someone asks about an aspect of your work. In fact, maybe they could check out your cards first, and the conversation could immediately proceed to something new!) I could use it for academics: a card could be a Theorem or Principle X, and contain the information I would need if, say, I had to give a talk on it on short notice. ~holden1@mit.edu #organizing thoughts [@Jacob: I overheard about this site in 6.868, and this idea has been on my mind for a while.

Im interested in OCR and/or audio recognition stuff, so the essay scanning, subtitles for conversations (+ translation), or the piano grader apps stood out for me. The best idea I had come up with so far was to use OCR to convert vocab lists at the end of textbook chapters or words in the glossary into flashcards that the user could study using their phone. This would be targeted towards middle school and high school students who have vocab quizzes. There seemed to be a lot of flashcard apps in the Android market, but none that I saw skipped the time-consuming part of having to enter in all the text for the flashcards yourself.-KatharineKatharine M Daly (dalyk@mit.edu) Posts: 2Joined: Fri Feb 11, 2011 11:41 amTopRe: IDEAS!by Eric Lubin (eblubin@mit.edu) » Sun Feb 05, 2012 11:52 pm',\

	'IWantA -- app that you input a list of items you want into that in turn lists all of the different ways you can get something based on whats available local to you, the Internet, etc. Then, when you happen to be nearing the date of the special sale, or a place where you can buy something, your iPhone notifies you. For instance, I want a bike, not urgently, and as cheaply as possible. I missed the Cambridge bike auction last term because I wasnt thinking about it, but now I wish I had gone to it -- I wish my iPhone app had notified me that there was the bike auction because I had a bike on my wish list. I could also buy one at Cambridge bicycles, but its too expensive. However, there are cheaper bike shops further out of town. Next time I travel further out of town near cheap bike shop, it would have been continued.Additionally, Im missing a glove right now. while visiting Yale, I actually notice that theres a North face store that I walked past like 3 times, and except for my inhibitions about absurd price, I would have bought the glove. Now I think it would have been worth it simply due to the convenience.Additionally, this could be integrated with social networking so that if your friends are near a place to pick something up for you, it would notify them as well.

What this would allow people to view is essentially find a person similar to them (maybe even income if anonymous) and see the scholarships of the person applied to.  This arose from a bunch of people asking me for a list of scholarships that I applied to. This is better than simply searching blindly on scholarship match web sites because it circumvents the individual scholarship vetting process; people dont apply to use the scholarships, or at least they wouldnt include them in the lists they submit. the key is to make this easy, like simply asking a friend for a list of scholarships.  The lists could either be plain text, or parsed by a regular expression that will naturalistically interpret the input to identify the deadlines and titles and links to each scholarship. Another useful feature would be to have a username based lookup so that friends can share their own lists. Only a simple database of initial lists is necessary to begin this process; 20 or so profiles perhaps.']
