DESCRIPTION: Take the workflows of top students and make or sell complete sets of customized materials to help other people adopt the workflows of the super productive people.
MORE: start up idea is to take the workflows of top students and make/sell complete sets of customize materials to help other people adopt the workflows of the super productive people.I think that that's half the battle, getting into the right life-rhythm. I bet for each stereotype of person, you can find some sort of optimize workflow and then you go and get the workflow kit for the type of person you are like are you like riley or (racks brains) my friend jenny or like cj whose system do you use well fine the person you learn like you could even make "learn like riley" or “learn like a thiel fellow” or “learn like a harvard student” “or _insert child prodigy here_” Example workflow “take a normal sheet of paper fold it hamburger style but then instead of folding it all the way to symmetry, give a quarter inch gap between the two folds then with the fold pointing to the right, fold it top-to-bottom 3 times unfold then write terms on outer flap, definitions on inner flap fold over, repeat IT'S HAPPY. I've done like 264 defines in 3 hours but actually a lot of perceived inefficiency or  failure /does/ come from shitty workflows once I have a system set up, the stuff practically teaches itself i'm just starting to hack school coursenotes: ocw formatting: latex killer ppts: magic markers THE LIST GOES ON.” In parallel, as college students, we’re  SITTING ON GOLD.(e.g.  my friends coursenotes/annotated copy of Poems Poets Poetry is a GOLDMINE. like she should just republish the darn anthology with her notes. http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/ makes his business off of this i want the workflow of someone super geniusly good - Jacob (and Riley)
PROBLEM: People aren’t productive.

TITLE: MedTime
DESCRIPTION: Track when people actually take their meds
MORE: what if you used an app to track when people actually /do/ take their meds
this is absolutely what we should be thinking about
there exist a number of drugs for which the main and important factor is the minimum blood level concentration is the important part
among these are birth control, seizure meds, beta-blockers and a whole bunch of other things
and you have to take them at the same time every day because you need to maintain minimum effective concentration
but, excepting beta-blockers, having a concentration in excess, up to about 3x the normal does, is not something that will hurt you
so, what would be cooler than reminding you to take your meds when you tend to sit down and eat dinner
is an app that analyzes when you actually do take your meds, and then suggests custom dosages based on your schedule
custom blister packs are actually not that hard, it's something that's done a lot for people who are on oral chemo and want to take more on the weekends because they have to work during the week
it's not something that's anywhere outside of the realm of physicians to prescribe, in fact, its actually in their best interest
PROBLEM: People don’t take their meds on schedule.
SOLUTION: Track when people actually take their meds, and remind them.

TITLE: Index card sharing
DESCRIPTION: Organize and share your thoughts by writing them concisely and linking them together.
MORE: A good way to organize your thoughts is to write them down concisely. An index card seems like a good length for a unit of thought: longer than a quote or decontextualized summary, shorter than a story or lesson. Index cards seem a good way to transmit thoughts: it is easy to learn information presented in bite-sized chunks, each centered around some principle you can easily remember. The title of the card can act as a "slogan" for the principle.
I am inspired by Trefethen's Index Cards: one mathematician wrote down his thoughts on science, education, politics, intelligence, etc. on ~350 index cards over a period of 40 years and published it as a book. (http://books.google.com/books/about/Trefethen_s_Index_Cards.html?id=hJT0tgAACAAJ)
Minsky's Society of Mind also strikes me as written in a similar way: while a page is more than an index card, the fact that each section is no more than a page has a focusing effect on the reader.
There are two parts to this project: allowing the user to create a system of cards, and then facilitating sharing.
Each index card has limited space but allows multimedia (for instance, putting in a simple picture/diagram as a symbol). You can hashtag index cards, search for others' cards on similar topics, rate cards, provide links, and make "connections" between different cards (and possibly specify the kind of connection, for instance hierarchical), much like a semantic net. This gives a way to visualize someone's thoughts (and almost "surf" their thoughts, in a way). I might have some good ideas which I write as a linear sequence of blog posts---but if I write them as index cards instead, this would force me to crystallize my ideas more, and allow them to be connected in a nonlinear fashion. Some possible uses: A card could be a quote, and then a anecdote around it. I could make one index card for every book I read, for instance---then anytime the book comes up in conversation I could pull up my index card on the phone and know exactly the thoughts I have about it, and be able to talk about it. (In fact, if I write up cards on a variety of topics, they could almost be a cheat sheet for conversation. If you had a repertoire of cards related to topics important to you, then you needn't grope for words, for instance, if someone asks about an aspect of your work. In fact, maybe they could check out your cards first, and the conversation could immediately proceed to something new!) I could use it for academics: a card could be a Theorem or Principle X, and contain the information I would need if, say, I had to give a talk on it on short notice.
PROBLEM: People’s thoughts are messy.
SOLUTION: Write them down on virtual index cards and organize them.

Comments:
*Cool! They are definitely similar, but not the same, for one automatically orders ingredients you do not have, and the other shows you what you can make with what you do have. Combine them possibly?
*Question: Would ‘method of preparation’ be a worthy sub-category for the application? In other words, "Recipes that require baking", "Recipes to be prepared on a skillet." Or.. even better, “select the appliances/cooking materials accessible to you” (Can you suggest a less wordy way of saying this?) I am envisioning this in the form of a checklist. - acousticcole@gmail.com

Also, I wish you could do align left and align right on the right and left-hand sides of the same line. This is, I feel, the basis for an entirely new creative outlet.
