"""
Documentation: "cmd" is the name of an add-on to d4d.
               It facilitat4es reasoning about natural language commands
               by parsing them into scored data structures containing an 'action'
               and an 'arg' to that action, with scores as to their likelyhood.
               
               The highest level things to pay attention to are:
               Creating an instance of cmd
               Method: sentence_to_cmd
               Method: prioritize_sentences
              
               All are documented below.
               
Release Notes:
  Jan 25, 2013
             Added more doc.
             Added method: prioritize_sentences
             Added methods pretty_print_cmd, pretty_print_cmds
             Added 'threshold' arguments
             Made cmd instances that hold an instance of d4d along with the 'actions' and threshold

class cmd:
  """An instance of the 'cmd' class has the properties:
     name:  A string. After its made, the instance can be accessed via cmd.name_of_instance.
            For example: d4d.c4  is the "default" instance that is automatically 
            created when you load 'cmd'. It uses d4d.c4 (Conceptnet4) for its d4d instance.
     d4di:  The instance of d4d used by this instance, or "any_format_assertions" accepted
             by d4d. In this case, an instance of d4d is made with the above 'name',
             and the provided assertions. If you want to use the other arguments to making
             an instance of d4d, create the instance of d4d normally and use it for
             this argument.
     actions: The dict of actions. For each element of the dict, the key is the command name,
              and the value is a list of possible args. Neither the args nor the actions
              should have synonyms in them. the d4di is used to find the mapping
              of an input 'synonym' to its canonical command or arg name,
              specficifed by 'actions'.
     threshold: A float between 1 and 0. sentences that recieve a score below this threshold
                are filtered out. Methods that take a threshold argument have a default value
                of None, meaning that the threshold is derived from this value of 'threshold',
                ie the value in 'self'.
    EXAMPLES:
    cmd(name="c4", 
        d4di=d4d.c4,
        actions={"watch":    ["tv", "dvd", "movie", "comedy", "sports", "house", "pride and prejudice"],
                  "channel": ["weather", "espn", "nbc", "sports"],
                  "volume":  ["loud", "soft", "up", "down"]
                },
        threshold=1)
    cmd.c4.sentence_to_cmd("I want to see football")
    cmd(name="cmd1", 
        d4di='''Football is a sport
                tv used for football
                tv used for watch
              ''',          
        actions={"watch":  ["tv", "dvd", "movie", "comedy", "sports", "house", "pride and prejudice"],
